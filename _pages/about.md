Welcome! I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Photonics, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, under the supervision of [You-Chia Chang](https://nycusng.web.nycu.edu.tw/pi/).  

I am interested in silicon photonics and metasurfaces. Over the past few years, I worked on monolithic integration between silicon photonics and metasurfaces.
Recently, I am working on increasing the resolution of the silicon photonic LiDAR system.
